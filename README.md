## 🚀 What I’m Passionate About

- **Web & Mobile Development**  
  - Crafting responsive, accessible interfaces with Next.js + ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS  
  - Building robust backends using Prisma, MySQL, and serverless API routes  
  - Experimenting with Flutter for cross-platform mobile apps  
- **Automotive & Engine Tinkering**  
  - Deep dive into 4G13A engine builds, scramblers, and carburetor setups  
  - Figuring out “reliable & tunable” engine recipes—cast iron blocks vs. aluminum heads  
  - Long-haul drives (8–12 hours) fuel my soul (and occasionally my grey smoke diagnostics)  
- **Digital Art & Design**  
  - Sketching concept art, creating UI mockups, and exploring pixel art  
  - Learning Blender basics for quick 3D mockups (future portfolio incoming!)  
- **Health & Fitness**  
  - On a mission: from **75 kg** → **60–65 kg**, building lean muscle & endurance  
  - Daily water-intake challenges (4 L straight), morning stretches, and weekend rides
